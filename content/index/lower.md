*Too much interesting stuff in this world.*

<!-- ## Vision

I am dedicated to becoming a researcher at the intersection of Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Psychology and Neuroscience. I want to understand the workings of the human mind and eventually use that knowledge
to create technologies that improve our living conditions.

I am deeply passionate about discovering and implementing the algorithms behind perception, cognition and behaviour.

Being in the middle of forming the foundation of my future scientific career, I am
learning about new topics and absorbing all advice, experiences and lessons I can.

Full of ideas, ambitious plans and a probably hopelessly overly idealistic worldview, I am trying to reach for the stars.
Let's see what the future holds. -->

### Fun 'facts'

- People tell me I look shorter on zoom than in real life.
- I was an uncle (second degree) before I was born.
- If you substitute *context* in <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/dghnf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ourpaper</a> with *state* it sounds pretty scary. (link needed)
- Because I grew up bilingually, I sometimes confuse numbers in the range of
  60-99: in German you say the last position first; in Spanish it is the other way
  around. (For some reason I only seem to make this error for numbers >60).
- I seem to be bad at _deciphering_ what people say, even though my
  hearing itself is good (according to some doctor in Berlin...).
- Bananas rule (*healthy, yummy, easy to eat, cheap, what do you want more from life?*).
- <a href="https://www.berliner-kaffeeroesterei.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The best hot chocolate place in Berlin</a>.
- Yes, I still like the US, although it sometimes feels scary.
- Surprisingly <a href="https://archive.org/details/williamjamesinma0000rich" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inspirational</a>.
- Put on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3oZZMFXBKCE5H3TOlmugPp?si=c32aec83128240e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80/90/00s music</a> and I _dance, dance, dance_.
- My metabolism does not abide by the laws of the universe, if I eat a piece of
  cake I gain double its weight the next day.
- Luckily, I lose weight as fast as I gain it.
- Yes, my phenotype is the analog of mixing coffee with milk.
- I am bad with remembering names AND faces, but I am not prosopagnosic.

_Good luck on your adventures._
